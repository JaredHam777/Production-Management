Directions: Just run the Solution.java file (make sure you have the /data/ folder in your workspace).  No extra libraries need!

Time Spent: ~2 hours
	*Over 1 hour was spent on the CSV data importing.
	I couldn't resist not making it adaptable to other product
	cost configurations.  Feel free to use other csv file configurations, just
	note how I have them setup right now (columns and rows might be switched)
	
IDE: Eclipse
